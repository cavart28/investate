    It is assumed that the initial investment is 1 unit in value and that it can be transferred between two investments A and B
    following the fees_func_AB. This function is really two in one: one for positive values (corresponding to transfers
    from A to B) and one for negative values (corresponding to transfer from B to A). The fees_func_AB is assumed to be
    a function of the total values invested in A and the total value invested in B. (reflecting a possible discount when the
    investments are large). In reality the fee is usually also a function of the transfer amount but this is more difficult
    to capture since the equation solved in rebalance_A_to_B become functional. To generalize rebalance_A_to_B, one would
    probably need to use some form of iterative approximation. I intend to trade with Robinhood, which has no fee, which is
    one more reason to take this simplified approach.
